## Description:

* This script tries to learn input data from the MINST's dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* It is a three layer network with 784-196-784 units in respective layers. 
* The code is written in Matlab
* This is a solution to assignment problem for Standford's UFLDL course
* This project uses 'minFunc' for optimization.
