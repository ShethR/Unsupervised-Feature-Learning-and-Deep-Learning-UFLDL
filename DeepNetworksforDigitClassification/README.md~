# Deep Networks for classification


## Description:
* Solution to assignmnet problem (UFLDL-standford http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial)
* This project trains a deep neural network to classfiy the MINST's dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* It is a four layer network(2 hidden layers) where the hidden layers are stacked autoencoders that compute complex features of the input
* Final layer is a softmax classifier
* Accuracy is further improved by fine tuning the weights using backpropogation
* The code is written in Matlab
* This project uses 'minFunc' for optimization.
